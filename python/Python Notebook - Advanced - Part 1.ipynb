    "* On the first call, the code `prev, curr = 0, 1` gets executed, then the `while True` loop is entered, and then it encounters the `yield curr` statement. It will produce the value that’s currently in the `curr` variable and become idle again. This value is passed to the `islice()` wrapper, which will produce the value (1 in this case) and `list` will add the value to the variable `res`.\n",
    "* Then, `list` asks `islice()` for the next value, which will ask `f` for the next value, which will unpause `f` from its previous state, resuming with the statement `prev, curr = curr, prev + curr`.\n",
    "* Then it re-enters the next iteration of the `while True` loop, and hits the `yield curr` statement, returning the next value of `curr`.\n",
    "* This happens until the output list is 10 elements long. When `list()` asks `islice()` for the 11th value, `islice()` will raise a __`StopIteration`__ exception, indicating that the end has been reached, and list will return the result: a list of 10 items, containing the first 10 Fibonacci numbers.\n",
