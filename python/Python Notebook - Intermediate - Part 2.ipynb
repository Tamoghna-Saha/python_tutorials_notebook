    "* \"w\" means write mode, for rewriting the contents of a file.\n",

    "\n",
    "The contents of a file that has been opened in text mode can be read using the read method. To read only a certain amount of a file, you can provide a number as an argument to the read function. This determines the number of bytes that should be read.\n",

    "After all contents in a file have been read, any attempts to read further from that file will return an empty string, because you are trying to read from the end of the file.\n",

    "write\n",
    "\n",
    "To write to files we use the write method, which writes a string to the file. The \"w\" mode will create a file, if it does not already exist. When a file is opened in write mode, the file's existing content is deleted. The write method returns the number of bytes written to a file, if successful.\n",
