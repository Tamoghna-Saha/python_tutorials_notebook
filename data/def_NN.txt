What is Neural Network?
A neural network is a processing unit that is capable to store knowledge and apply it to make predictions. A neural network mimics the brain in a way where the network acquires knowledge from its environment through a learning process. Then, intervention connection strengths known as synaptic weights are used to store the acquired knowledge. In the learning process, the synaptic weights of the network are modified in such a way so as to attain the desired objective.

A neural network architecture comprises of 3 types of layers:

Input Layer: The first layer in the network which receives input (training observations) and passed to the next hidden layer(s)
Hidden Layer: The intermediate processing layer(s) which perform specific tasks on the incoming data and pass on the output generated by them to the next output layer
Output Layer: The final layer of the network which generates the desired output
Each of these layers are composed of Perceptrons which is analogous to the neuron of the our nervous system.
