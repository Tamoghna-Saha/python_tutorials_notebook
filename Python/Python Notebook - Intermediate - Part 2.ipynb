    "\n",
    "__List slices__ provides an advanced way of retrieving values from a list. Basic list slicing involves indexing a list with __two colon-separated integers__. These three arguments are lower limit, upper limit and step. This returns a new list containing all the values in the old list between the indices specified. By default, lower limit is at index 0, upper limit is at the last value and step is +1.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also take a step backwards. When __negative values__ are used for the first and second values in a slice, they count __from the end of list__.\n",
    "\n",
    "The indexing of the iterable item starts from 0 if we take it from left and -1 if we take it from the right.\n",
