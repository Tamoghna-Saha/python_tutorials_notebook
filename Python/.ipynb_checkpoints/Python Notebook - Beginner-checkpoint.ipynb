    "Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting language to connect existing components together.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __General-Purpose__ -> designed to be used for writing software in the widest variety of application domains\n",
    "* __High-level__ -> designed to be more or less independent of a particular type of computer, human-readable friendly\n",
    "* __Interpreted__ -> designed to execute instructions of a program directly, without previously compiling a program into machine-language instructions\n",
    "* __Scripting__ -> languages do not require the compilation step and are rather interpreted\n",

    "| **No intermediate object code** is generated, hence memory efficient | **Generates intermediate object code** which further requires linking, hence requires **more memory** |\n",
    "| Less amount of time to **analyze** the source code | More amount of time |\n",
    "| Overall **execution** is slower | Faster |\n",
    "| Easier to **debug** but less efficient | Difficult but more efficient |\n",

    "__NOTE__ : While classifying a language as scripting language or programming language, the environment on which it would execute must be taken into consideration. The reason why this is important is that we can design an interpreter for C language and use it as a scripting language, and at the same time, we can design a compiler for JavaScript and use it as a non-scripting(compiled language). A live example of this is __V8__, the JavaScript engine of Google Chrome, which compiles the JavaScript code into machine code, rather than interpreting it."
